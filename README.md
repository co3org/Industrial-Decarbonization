## Introduction

Industrial activities, from steel mills to cloud servers, account for **~30–40% of global GHG emissions** when including indirect emissions from electricity, heat, transport, and supply chains. Achieving net-zero by 2050 requires **phasing out emissions from every industrial process, service, and infrastructure system**.

This repository is a living, community-driven encyclopedia for **industrial decarbonization in its fullest sense**:  
- **Manufacturing** (cement, steel, chemicals)  
- **Energy-intensive services** (data centers, logistics, cold storage)  
- **Enabling infrastructure** (power grids, ports, waste systems)  

We combine technical depth, policy insights, and real-world case studies to support engineers, executives, policymakers, and climate advocates.

## What is Industrial Decarbonization?

> **Industrial decarbonization is the phasing out of atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from all aspects of industry.**

This includes:
- **Direct (Scope 1)** emissions from fuel combustion and chemical reactions
- **Indirect (Scope 2)** emissions from purchased electricity and heat
- **Value chain (Scope 3)** emissions from raw materials, transport, and product use

It goes **beyond factories** to include:
- Server farms running AI models
- Refrigerated warehouses and cold chains
- Ports, airports, and freight networks
- Commercial office towers and retail operations
