# Carbon Insetting: Historical Trends and Future Opportunities

Carbon insetting offers a novel approach to decarbonization by prioritizing emissions reduction efforts directly within a company’s supply chain. Unlike offsetting, which compensates for emissions through external, often unrelated projects, insetting focuses on taking tangible steps within business operations to permanently reduce or avoid emissions. This article reviews the evolution, current trends, and key applications of insetting across agriculture, marine transportation, and aviation.

## A Brief History

Although the term “insetting” is relatively new, the underlying practices date back to at least 2005. Early adopters, particularly those involved with alternative fuels and regenerative agriculture, began implementing decarbonization measures that were separate from switching to grid-based power. Over time, these practices evolved into explicit, defined methods that directly target operational emissions within one’s business and up and down one’s supply chain. Today, insetting is recognized as an essential tool for companies committed to reducing their carbon footprint while strengthening supply chain resilience. While offsetting has operated under the assumption emissions reductions were not possible within one’s business, and thus other investments were needed to off-set their operations, this line of thinking increasingly is not true. From alternative raw materials to switching out suppliers, changing operational processes to new transportation methods, there are an increasing number of reduced or zero emissions practices that businesses can take to inset or reduce emissions within their supply chains.

## Sector Specific Advancements of Insetting

### Agriculture

Agriculture is one of the most well developed sectors for insetting. Nature-based solutions such as improved crop rotation, agroforestry, and soil conservation have been widely adopted to enhance carbon sequestration. Downstream brands have looked to upstream farms and agricultural suppliers to adjust their practices to reduce emissions or sequester carbon at production. In recent years, standard-setting organizations have validated many of these practices, helping to ensure that insetting in the agricultural sector delivers measurable and lasting emissions reductions. In particular, SBTi’s FLAG (Forestry, Land and Agriculture) program helps standardize how land-intensive sectors can set science-based targets for greenhouse gas reduction targets within their operations. As a result, agricultural insetting has become a well-understood and increasingly common component of broader sustainability strategies.

### Maritime Transportation

In maritime transportation, insetting initiatives are closely tied to the early use of alternative fuels in the mid-2010s, and codification of policies for “Book and Claim” in the early 2020s. This latter policy mechanism allowed companies purchase alternative fuels for use within a shipping network without needing to directly have the fuel on one’s own shipment. The detachment of purchasing from use simplified the tracking and reporting of emissions reductions, but also encouraged the use of cleaner fuels in shipping, road transport, and other logistics operations. Most recently, insetting in shipping has expanded beyond fuel purchases to also include larger investments, like retrofitting engines to handle cleaner fuels.

### Aviation

The airline industry is also embracing the principles of insetting through the growing use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs). While the EU’s ETS system began pushing decarbonization in intra-EU flights as early as 2012, global airlines have only begun to turn to Sustainable Aviation Fuels in the past few years to reduce their carbon footprint. Many airlines are exploring adoption of a Book and Claim systems for SAF, allowing them to purchase the environmental benefits of cleaner fuels even when physical SAF isn’t readily available. Various reports estimate that 5–10% of total jet fuel in 2030 could be SAF.

## Challenges and the Regulatory Environment

Despite its promise, carbon insetting faces challenges related to standardization and cost. Varying definitions, and, for many years, the absence of uniform guidelines in carbon accounting for insetting have created uncertainty for companies considering insetting projects. Moreover, the need for third-party certification to verify insetting emissions reductions only recently became common practice. Regulatory bodies and standard-setting organizations are working to establish clearer frameworks. Upcoming guidelines — such as those being developed by the GHG Protocol for management of Scope 3 emissions — will help standardize how insetting is defined, measured, and reported. This guidance will boost confidence, clarify standards, and increase participation across industries.

## A New Opportunity for Meaningful Emissions Reductions

Carbon insetting is becoming a practical and effective strategy for reducing supply chain emissions across various sectors. By leveraging insetting, companies can integrate sustainability into their core operations and achieve meaningful environmental benefits.
