# Insetting for Hard-to-Abate Sectors

## Introduction

The global push for net-zero emissions by 2050 requires unprecedented action, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors where emissions are difficult to eliminate due to technological and economic constraints. These sectors account for approximately 30% of global CO2 emissions, making their decarbonization critical (IEA). Downstream brands, such as consumer goods companies, are under growing pressure to address Scope 3 emissions, which often constitute 70–90% of their carbon footprint.

No single business can achieve decarbonization alone. Collaboration and co-investment in greener infrastructure are essential to scale solutions equitably and effectively. Insetting offers a pathway to align environmental goals with financial returns, ensuring additionality and fostering partnerships across value chains. As noted by McKinsey, the voluntary carbon market, which includes both offset and inset credits, is expected to grow significantly, with demand potentially increasing by 15 times by 2030 and the market worth more than $50bn.

## What is Insetting?

Insetting involves implementing or financing emission reduction projects within a company’s own supply chain or value chain, rather than purchasing external carbon offsets. This approach is gaining traction as companies seek to achieve true emission reductions rather than merely compensating for them. As noted by IMD, "The big change in mentality is going from offsets to insets," highlighting the shift towards decarbonizing one’s own value chain.

Unlike offsetting, which has faced criticism for greenwashing and questionable emissions reductions, insetting focuses on direct, verifiable impacts within the company’s operations. Reports emphasize that while offsetting can support decarbonization beyond a company’s footprint, insetting ensures that reductions are tied directly to the value chain, enhancing credibility and transparency.

## Key Benefits of Insetting

1. Direct Impact: Emission reductions occur within the value chain, ensuring alignment with corporate sustainability goals.
2. Additionality: Insetting projects deliver reductions that would not have occurred without targeted investment.
3. Financial Gains: Investments in green infrastructure can reduce operational costs and create new revenue streams through inset credits.
4. Collaboration: Insetting encourages partnerships across industries, suppliers, and communities, fostering equitable decarbonization.
5. Reputation and Compliance: Demonstrating tangible progress enhances brand value and aligns with emerging regulatory requirements.

## Case Studies: Insetting in Hard-to-Abate Sectors

The following case studies illustrate how insetting can be applied in hard-to-abate sectors, drawing on hypothetical scenarios informed by industry trends and real-world examples.

### Case Study 1: Steel Industry — Green Hydrogen Integration

Sector: Heavy Industry  
Challenge: Steel production is energy-intensive, relying heavily on coal-based blast furnaces, contributing 7–9% of global emissions.  
Insetting Solution: A consortium of steel manufacturers, supported by C3, co-invested in a green hydrogen production facility to replace coal in steelmaking. The project was implemented within the supply chain, with hydrogen sourced from renewable energy. Downstream brands, including automotive companies, co-funded the initiative to reduce their Scope 3 emissions.  
Outcomes:

- Emission Reduction: 30% reduction in Scope 1 emissions for steelmakers and Scope 3 emissions for downstream brands.
- Inset Credits: Generated credits equivalent to 500,000 tCO2e annually, shared among partners.
- Financial Gains: Reduced energy costs by 15% over five years; credits sold to partners generated $10M in revenue.
- Additionality: The project was only viable through collaborative investment, including downstream contributions.
- Equity: Local communities were involved in job creation, with training programs for green energy roles.

### Case Study 2: Aviation — Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Supply Chain

Sector: Aviation  
Challenge: Aviation accounts for 2% of global emissions, with limited scalable alternatives to fossil-based jet fuel.  
Insetting Solution: C3 facilitated a partnership between airlines, fuel producers, agricultural suppliers, and downstream travel companies to develop a SAF supply chain using bio-based feedstocks. Travel brands co-invested in SAF production and committed to long-term offtake agreements to reduce their Scope 3 emissions.  
Outcomes:

- Emission Reduction: 50% reduction in lifecycle emissions for SAF, benefiting airlines and downstream brands.
- Inset Credits: 200,000 tCO2e credits generated annually, supporting net-zero commitments.
- Financial Gains: SAF adoption reduced exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices; credits traded for $5M in 2024.
- Additionality: Downstream offtake commitments enabled scaled SAF production.
- Equity: Feedstock sourcing prioritized smallholder farmers, providing stable income and training.

### Case Study 3: Shipping — Electrified Port Infrastructure

Sector: Maritime  
Challenge: Shipping contributes 3% of global emissions, with ports often relying on diesel-powered equipment.  
Insetting Solution: C3 coordinated a collaboration between shipping companies, port operators, renewable energy providers, and downstream retailers to electrify port operations. Retailers co-invested to reduce Scope 3 emissions from logistics.  
Outcomes:

- Emission Reduction: 40% reduction in Scope 2 emissions at ports and Scope 3 emissions for retailers.
- Inset Credits: 150,000 tCO2e credits generated, shared with partners.
- Financial Gains: Electrification reduced fuel costs by 20%; credits generated $3M in revenue.
- Additionality: Downstream funding was critical to overcoming high capital costs.
- Equity: Local workforce was upskilled for electric equipment maintenance, focusing on underrepresented groups.

## Real-World Examples

Beyond these hypothetical scenarios, real-world examples underscore insetting’s potential. Deloitte, for instance, integrates insetting-like strategies through its Beyond Value Chain Mitigation (BVCM) portfolio, investing in projects like blue carbon and seagrass restoration to reduce emissions and enhance biodiversity (Climate Impact Partners). Similarly, Freshfields supports the TIST Community Reforestation Program in East Africa, sourcing carbon credits from projects that align with their sustainability goals, suggesting an insetting approach (Climate Impact Partners). These examples demonstrate how companies can embed insetting within broader decarbonization strategies.

## The Role of Inset Credits and Additionality

Inset credits, generated from insetting projects, play a crucial role in quantifying and monetizing emission reductions. Unlike offsets, which may fund unrelated projects, inset credits are tied to specific, verifiable reductions within the value chain. Additionality ensures that these reductions would not have occurred without the insetting project, distinguishing them from business-as-usual improvements.

A study in Nature Communications found that only 16% of carbon credits issued to certain projects constitute real emission reductions, highlighting the need for rigorous additionality standards (Nature Communications). McKinsey notes that the voluntary carbon market faces challenges such as fragmentation, limited pricing data, and scarce high-quality credits, proposing solutions like shared verification principles and standardized contracts.

## Ensuring Additionality

C3 employs rigorous methodologies to verify additionality, including:

- Baseline Scenarios: Demonstrating that emissions would not have been reduced without the project.
- Financial Analysis: Confirming that the project required external investment to be viable.
- Third-Party Audits: Independent verification of emission reductions and credit issuance.

## Challenges in Equitable Collaboration

While insetting fosters collaboration, achieving equity in co-investment and benefit-sharing remains a challenge:

- Unequal Resources: Smaller companies may lack the capital to participate in large-scale projects.
- Geographic Disparities: Benefits may concentrate in developed regions, leaving developing economies behind.
- Community Engagement: Ensuring local communities are meaningfully involved requires deliberate effort.

## C3’s Approach to Equity

- Tiered Investment Models: Flexible financing options allow smaller players to contribute proportionally.
- Regional Focus: Prioritizing projects in underserved regions to balance global impact.
- Stakeholder Inclusion: Engaging local communities in project design and implementation, ensuring job creation and skill development.

## Benefits for Downstream Brands: Reducing Scope 3 Emissions

Downstream brands, such as consumer goods, retail, and service companies, are increasingly accountable for Scope 3 emissions, which often account for 70–90% of their carbon footprint. Insetting enables these brands to actively participate in upstream decarbonization efforts, directly addressing Scope 3 emissions while fostering collaboration and financial benefits. For example, Maersk, a leading shipping company, has been recognized for its transparency in carbon markets, ranking highest in the Corporate Climate Responsibility Monitor 2023 (Carbon Market Watch). By co-investing in upstream projects, downstream brands can achieve verifiable reductions and share in inset credits.

## How Downstream Brands Benefit

1. Direct Scope 3 Reduction: Co-investing in upstream projects like green hydrogen, SAF, or electrified ports achieves verifiable reductions in supply chain emissions.
2. Active Participation: Insetting allows brands to move beyond passive offset purchases, taking a proactive role through funding and offtake agreements.
3. Financial Returns: Brands can share in inset credits, using them for compliance or trading for revenue.
4. Brand Value and Transparency: Tangible contributions enhance reputation and meet consumer and investor demands for sustainability.
5. Risk Mitigation: Participation reduces exposure to carbon taxes, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory penalties.

## Active Participation Through Co-Investment and Offtake

Downstream brands can engage in insetting through:

- Co-Investment: Providing capital to fund upstream projects, such as SAF production or renewable energy infrastructure.
